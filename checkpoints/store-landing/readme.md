Brief design choices made during development:

- Bootstrap framework: Leveraged Bootstrap 5 for its robust grid system, responsive utilities, and pre-built components to speed up development and ensure cross-device compatibility.
- Mobile-first & responsive: Built on Bootstrap's grid and utility classes to ensure layouts adapt smoothly from small screens to large, with a stacked hero on mobile and a side spotlight on desktop.
- Semantic structure: Used semantic elements (header, main, section, article, footer) to improve accessibility, readability, and SEO.
- Simple visual system: Limited color palette with a single primary accent for CTAs, paired with the Inter font for a clean, modern UI and clear visual hierarchy.
