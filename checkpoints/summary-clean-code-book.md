Title: Clean Code
Author: Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)
Purpose in Course: This book serves as a foundational text for understanding professional coding standards, with a strong focus on readability, maintainability, and collaboration.

Chapter 2: Meaningful Names (4 hours)
Explanation

This chapter stresses that names in code—variables, functions, classes—are not trivial details but core design decisions. Poor naming increases cognitive load, while good naming makes code self-documenting.

Martin argues that names should clearly communicate intent, avoid unnecessary abbreviations, and be precise enough that comments become less necessary. Consistency and domain-specific language are also emphasized.

Summary

Students learn that meaningful names:

Make code easier to read and understand

Reduce the need for explanatory comments

Improve teamwork by creating shared understanding
By the end of this chapter, students should see naming as a key skill, not an afterthought.

Chapter 3: Functions (4 hours)
Explanation

This chapter focuses on writing small, focused functions that do exactly one thing. Martin introduces principles such as:

Functions should be short

They should have a single responsibility

They should use clear inputs and minimal side effects

Refactoring large, complex functions into smaller ones is presented as a core habit of clean coding.

Summary

Students learn that well-designed functions:

Improve readability and testability

Make systems easier to extend and debug

Encourage modular thinking
This chapter builds the foundation for writing scalable and maintainable software.

Chapter 4: Comments (4 hours)
Explanation

Rather than promoting heavy commenting, this chapter challenges the idea that comments fix bad code. Martin argues that comments often compensate for unclear logic and can become outdated or misleading.

He explains when comments are valuable—such as clarifying intent, warning about consequences, or documenting public APIs—and when they should be avoided.

Summary

Students will understand that:

Clear code is better than commented code

Comments should explain why, not what

Fewer, high-quality comments are better than many low-quality ones
This shifts students toward writing expressive, readable code first.

Chapter 6: Objects and Data Structures (4 hours)
Explanation

This chapter explores the difference between object-oriented design and data-oriented design. Martin explains how objects encapsulate behavior, while data structures expose data, and why mixing the two carelessly leads to brittle systems.

The chapter helps students understand how to balance abstraction, encapsulation, and flexibility.

Summary

Students learn how to:

Design objects that hide internal details

Choose between objects and data structures intentionally

Structure systems that are easier to modify and extend
This chapter deepens architectural thinking beyond syntax.

Overall Learning Impact

Together, these chapters help students move from “code that works” to code that communicates, laying a strong foundation for professional-level software development.
